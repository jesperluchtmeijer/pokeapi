Project Title: PokeAPI Learning Project
Overview:

This project is a learning endeavor that combines the power of ExpressJS and NodeJS to interact with the PokeAPI. It serves as an educational tool for individuals interested in web development, particularly in the realm of API consumption and server-side scripting.
Technologies Used:

    ExpressJS & NodeJS: The project utilizes ExpressJS, a popular NodeJS framework for building web applications and APIs. NodeJS, on the other hand, provides the runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side.

    PokeAPI: The project leverages the PokeAPI, a RESTful API that provides comprehensive data about Pokémon. By integrating with this API, the project demonstrates how to fetch and manipulate external data within a web application.

Purpose:

The primary objective of this project is to facilitate learning. It serves as a practical example for students and developers to understand how to interact with APIs using ExpressJS and NodeJS. By exploring real-world scenarios, such as retrieving Pokémon data, users can grasp key concepts in web development and deepen their understanding of server-side scripting.
